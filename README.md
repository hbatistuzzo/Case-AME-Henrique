This data viz project comes from the fintech AME-Digital's case for Data Engineers. The case itself is based on the Stack Overflow 2018 Developer Survey (available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/stack-overflow-2018-developer-survey).
Nearly 100,000 developers took the 30-minute survey in January 2018, answering questions ranging from basic info (gender, age, job title, annual salary estimate) to subjective opinions regarding ethics in coding and responsability towards AI creations.
